Hello, my name is Rahul Jindal, and this weather application uses front-end and back-end as well react.js and vite.js to help implement an API key which retrieves information about the weather of a location. Geocoding was also implemented to help ensure that the search criteria for the weather application was being met (postal code, zip code, landmarks, etc). Minimal amounts of HTML and CSS were used to further develop the application and ensure that it looks visually appealing, and a No-SQL database was used (mongodb) to help create, read, update, and delete infomration, which can be seen in this video. https://share.vidyard.com/watch/msu3kYWcyAN7uGAnCv61US?
